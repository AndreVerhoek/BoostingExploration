    "# House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques\n",
    "The purpose of this exercise is to get familiar with both Jupyter and boosting techniques, using this [Kaggle challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/). In this challenge the idea is to predict the sales price for each house. The prediction is evaluated via RMSE of the log of the predicted and observed sales prices."

    "## Boosting\n",
    "Boosting is a machine learning ensemble meta-algorithm for primarily reducing bias, and also variance in supervised learning, and a family of machine learning algorithms that convert weak learners to strong ones [(Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boosting_(machine_learning)).\n",
    "Since we have the observed sales data, it makes sense to use supervised learning. New for me are _ensemble_ algorithms. Here multiple models (all with their own hypothesis) are trained and the combined prediction gives a better score than the individual one. This is based upon a paper from [Michael Kerns (1988)](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns/papers/boostnote.pdf) around the question \"Can a set of weak learners create a single strong learner?\" and the affirmative answer of [Robert E. Schapire (1990)](https://web.archive.org/web/20121010030839/http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~schapire/papers/strengthofweak.pdf). Note that next to boosting, there are also bagging (bootstrap aggregation) and stacking inside the machine learning ensemble family.\n",
    "\n",
    "Boosting is not a fixed set of algorithms, but centralises around the idea of using multiple weak learning classifiers, which are aggregated into a final classifier using the accuracy of each weak learning classifier as weight. AdaBoost was one of the first algorithms (developed by Schapire and Y. Freund), followed by many others usually in the same framework as AdaBoost, boosting performs gradient descent in a function space using a convex cost function. Hence, the assumption is a convex cost function on which a gradient descent algorithm is applied. The latter is remarkable similar to [Column Generation](https://www.or.rwth-aachen.de/research/publications/colgen.pdf), where a subgradient algorithm is usually used to solve the Lagrangian relaxation. This is something we (myself with three others) applied in a [case study](https://github.com/rowtricker/SeminarEUR) for the Dutch rail company (NS/Nedtrain).\n",
    "\n",
    "Test all the different boosting algorithms will be a stretch, therefore I will limit this to the following three:\n",
    "* AdaBoost, since it is the first\n",
    "* XGboost, which seems to be the most popular recently\n",
    "* LogitBoost, this uses a logistic cost function. Since this Kaggle challenge also does that, perhaps it's a good fit.\n",
    "* (Optional) Gradient Tree Boosting, next to XGboost and AdaBoost among the most popular inside Kaggle competitions."

    "### AdaBoost\n",
    "Ignoring the mathematical functionality of AdaBoost, AdaBoost works in principle through these steps:\n",
    "1. Selects a random training subset.\n",
    "2. Iterative training of the model by selecting the training set based upon the accurate prediction of the last training.\n",
    "  * Here a higher weight gets assigned to observations that are wrongly classified in order to increase the chance these observations are picked for classification in the next training.\n",
    "  * In each iteration the weight of the trained classifer is set according to the accuracy of the classifier, the higher the accuracy the higher the weight.\n",
    "  * Iteration is repeated until the complete training data fits without any errors or specified maximum number of iterations is reached.\n",
    "6. Final classification is done by \"voting\" over all the built learning algorithms.\n",
